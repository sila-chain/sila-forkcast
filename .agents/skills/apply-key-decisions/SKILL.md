description: Propagate a call's fork stage-change decisions into SIP data files. Use when a call's key_decisions.json records SIPs proposed/considered/scheduled/etc. for a fork (e.g. "PFI for Hegota") and the SIP JSONs need their forkRelationships updated to match.

## Apply key decisions to SIP fork relationships

A call's `key_decisions.json` records `stage_change` decisions — e.g. ACDE #240 proposed five SIPs for inclusion (PFI) in Hegota. This skill reads those decisions and, for each affected SIP, updates `src/data/sips/{id}.json` so its `forkRelationships` reflect the new fork status, and attempts to add the presenter as a champion.

### Schema

- Types: `src/types/sip.ts` (`ForkRelationship`, `Champion`, `KeyDecision`).
- Example SIP with populated relationships: `src/data/sips/7805.json`.
- `stage_change.to` values map 1:1 onto `statusHistory[].status` (`Proposed`, `Considered`, `Scheduled`, `Included`, `Declined`, `Withdrawn`). "PFI" = `Proposed`, "CFI" = `Considered`, "SFI" = `Scheduled`.

### Step 1: Gather input

Ask the user for the **call ref** as `{type}/{number}` (e.g. `acde/240`). From it:

1. Resolve the artifact dir by glob: `public/artifacts/{type}/*_{number}/` (folder is `{date}_{numberPadded}`, e.g. `2026-07-02_240`).
2. Read `key_decisions.json` from that dir. It's the source of truth for what changed.
3. Derive the two fields every new `statusHistory` entry needs:
   - **`call`**: `{type}/{number}` with the number as a plain integer, no leading zeros (e.g. `acde/240`, `acdt/85`). This is the `${type}/${number}` format used throughout existing SIPs.
   - **`date`**: the `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix of the artifact folder name (also matches the `meeting` field's date).

### Step 2: Collect the decisions

From `key_decisions.json`, select every entry where **all** of these hold:

- `type == "stage_change"`
- `fork` is present (e.g. `"Hegota"`)
- `stage_change.to` is present
- `sips` is non-empty

Each such entry yields one or more `(sip, forkName, status)` tuples (an entry usually has a single SIP). Ignore `type: "other"` entries and any with an empty `sips` array — those aren't per-SIP status changes.

List the tuples back to the user before editing so they can spot anything off.

### Step 3: Update each SIP's forkRelationships

For each `(sip, forkName, status)`, open `src/data/sips/{sip}.json`:

1. Find an existing `forkRelationships` entry whose `forkName` matches.
   - **None found**: append a new relationship:
     ```json
     {
       "forkName": "{forkName}",
       "statusHistory": [
         { "status": "{status}", "call": "{call}", "date": "{date}" }
       ]
     }
     ```
     Do **not** set `isHeadliner` / `wasHeadlinerCandidate` for a plain stage change — those are only for headliner candidacies and this skill doesn't infer them.
   - **Found**: append a new `statusHistory` entry (keep the array ordered oldest → newest). Skip if an identical `status`+`call` entry already exists (idempotent — re-running the skill must not create duplicates).
2. Preserve all other fields and formatting; only touch `forkRelationships`.

### Step 4: Attempt a champion (presenter)

For each SIP that just got a new/updated relationship, try to add **one** champion — the person who championed the proposal. Only add a champion if the relationship has no `champions` yet.

The champion is usually the person who **added the proposal to the call agenda** by commenting on the ACDE/ACDC GitHub issue (in `sila/pm`). This is the most reliable signal — more reliable than who spoke on the call, since presenters sometimes speak on behalf of the actual champion.

1. **Primary signal — agenda comment**: Check the call's GitHub agenda issue in `sila/pm` for comments proposing each SIP. The commenter is the champion candidate. If the agenda issue is not readily available, fall back to the transcript.
2. **Fallback — transcript**: Find the presentation timestamp from `tldr.json` highlights (e.g. `eip_proposals_{fork}` section), falling back to the `key_decisions` entry's `timestamp`. Read `transcript_corrected.vtt` around that timestamp and identify the **presenter** — the dominant speaker introducing the SIP (skip one-line interjections from the host/others). The VTT speaker label is your candidate (labels are sometimes Discord handles like `soispoke`, sometimes full names like `Ansgar Dietrichs`).
3. Cross-check the candidate against the SIP's `author` field. Authors look like `Thomas Thiery (@soispoke)`; the VTT label may be a full name (`Toni Wahrstätter`) or a handle (`soispoke`). Match the presenter to one of the authors by either the name or the `@handle`. The champion need not be an author (e.g. someone else may champion an SIP on behalf of the original author), but author-match gives extra confidence. Once identified:
   - **`name`**: use the person's full name as it appears in the `author` field or as they are commonly known.
   - **`discord`**: the person's **Discord** handle. This is **not** the GitHub handle in the `author` field — e.g. `@nerolation` → `nero_eth`, `@benaadams` → `ben_a_adams`. Never derive `discord` from the GitHub handle. Use the known-mappings table below or ask the user; **omit `discord`** if you can't confirm it rather than guessing.

   Known mappings (extend as you confirm more):
   | Author | GitHub | Discord |
   |--------|--------|---------|
   | Thomas Thiery | @soispoke | soispoke |
   | Toni Wahrstätter | @nerolation | nero_eth |
   | Ben Adams | @benaadams | ben_a_adams |
   | Etan Kissling | @etan-status | etan-status |
   | Hadrien Croubois | @amxx | hadriencroubois |
   | Jochem Brouwer | - | jochembrouwer |
   | Kevaundray Wedderburn | @kevaundray | kevaundray |
   | Alex Forshtat | @forshtat | alexf5200 |
   | Derek Chiang | - | derekchiang |
4. If the presenter is a facilitator speaking on someone's behalf (e.g. Ansgar, Pari, Nixo) or doesn't clearly map to an author or agenda commenter, **do not guess** — leave `champions` off and flag that SIP so the user can supply the champion.

Add the champion to that fork's relationship only (max 3 per schema; this skill adds at most 1).

### Step 5: Validate

```bash
npm run compile-sips
npm run lint
```

Fix any errors before continuing. `compile-sips` catches malformed SIP JSON.

### Step 6: Confirm with the user

Show a summary table: SIP | fork | status added | champion (or "needs confirmation"). Highlight any SIPs where the presenter couldn't be resolved, and ask the user to confirm champions before committing — presenter attribution is the least certain part.

### Step 7: PR

1. Branch like `apply-decisions-{type}-{number}` (e.g. `apply-decisions-acde-240`).
2. Commit: `data: apply {TYPE} {number} fork decisions to SIPs` (e.g. `data: apply ACDE 240 fork decisions to SIPs`).
3. Push and open a PR. Do NOT use `#N` for the call number in the title/body — GitHub treats it as an issue tag. Write `{TYPE} {number}` (e.g. `ACDE 240`).
4. In the PR body, list the SIPs updated (fork, status, champion) and note any champions the user confirmed manually.

### Step 8: Retrospective

After the PR, note any friction (wrong presenter matches, missing tldr timestamps, ambiguous forks) and offer to patch this skill.
