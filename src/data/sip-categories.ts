// Thematic categories for the proposals shown on the rank page. Grouping is by
// what a proposal is *for*, not by its dependency graph.
//
// The cuts follow the themes in the Ethlabs Hegotá view
// (https://ethlabs.org/writings/hegota-view.html), which is the most worked-out
// public grouping of this fork's proposals. The *names* here are deliberately
// not theirs: theirs carry the recommendation ("FOCIL: strengthen
// censorship-resistance"), and Forkcast's own chrome has to stay neutral, so
// each is reduced to the mechanism or area it covers.
//
// Categories are declared in display order. The page groups by layer first, so a
// category shows up under every layer its SIPs belong to. SIPs listed here that
// are not up for ranking are ignored, and SIPs in no category at all fall into a
// trailing "Uncategorized".
